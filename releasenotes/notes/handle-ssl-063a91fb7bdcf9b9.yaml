features:
  - Ironic Python Agent now can access other services
    (Ironic, Inspector, image backend) when those are configured with
    HTTPS endpoints and use custom server certificates or require
    client certificates.
    It is possible to add a custom Certificate Authority (CA) file and client
    certificate files to the deploy ramdisk during build,
    and provide paths to those as corresponding new options
    in ``ironic_python_agent.conf`` configuration file.
    Validation of server certificate can be turned off with ``insecure``
    config option or via ``ipa-insecure`` kernel boot parameter.
    This should make it possible to run IPA in CI-like environments that use
    HTTPS endpoints with self-signed sertificates.
